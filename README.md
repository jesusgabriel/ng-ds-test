Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27
---------------30
-----------15       --45
--------10 -20    -40  -50
--------------27
Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))
-----this tree is balanced
Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))
---------------30
-----------15       --45
--------10 -20    -40  -50
--------------27
----------------29

Consider the following tree:
--------5
------2-----8
----1--3
--0

Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance?

How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))
-------2
-----1  --5

0 3 8

Go to my angular projects github repo and do one of them. Don't clone the repository, but rather add all the files to the folder which corresponds to your github repo. Add the files right at the root of your repo, not within a subfolder. Make sure you upload it to fvi-grad.com and also to a github repository.
